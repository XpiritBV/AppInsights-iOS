## AppInsights SDK iOS (1.0-alpha.2)

## Introduction

This article describes how to integrate AppInsights into your iOS apps. The SDK  allows to send application metrics (events, traces, metrics, and pageviews) to the server.

## Requirements

The SDK runs on devices with iOS 6.0 or higher.

<a id="download"></a> 
## Download & Extract

1. Download the latest [AppInsights SDK for iOS](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppInsights-iOS/releases/download/v1.0-alpha.2/AppInsights-1.0-alpha.2.zip) framework.

2. Unzip the file. A new folder `AppInsights` is created.

3. Move the folder into your project directory. We usually put 3rd-party code into a subdirectory named `Vendor`, so we move the directory into it.

<a id="xcode"></a> 
## Set up Xcode

1. Drag & drop `AppInsights.framework` from your project directory to your Xcode project.
2. Similar to above, our projects have a group `Vendor`, so we drop it there.
3. Select `Create groups for any added folders` and set the checkmark for your target. Then click `Finish`.
4. Select your project in the `Project Navigator` (⌘+1).
5. Select your app target.
6. Select the tab `Build Phases`.
7. Expand `Link Binary With Libraries`.
8. Add the following system frameworks, if they are missing:
	- `Foundation`
	- `SystemConfiguration`
	- `UIKit`
	- `CoreTelephony`(only required if iOS > 7.0)
9. Open the info.plist of your app target and add a new field of type *String*. Name it `MSAIInstrumentationKey` and set your AppInsights instrumentation key as its value.

## Modify Code 

### Objective-C

2. Open your `AppDelegate.m` file.
3. Add the following line at the top of the file below your own #import statements:

	```objectivec
	#import <AppInsights/AppInsights.h>
	```
4. Search for the method `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
5. Add the following lines to setup and start the AppInsights SDK:

	```objectivec
	[[MSAIAppInsights sharedInstance] setup];
	// Do some additional configuration if needed here
	...
	[[MSAIAppInsights sharedInstance] start];
	```

	You can also use the following shortcut:

	```objectivec
	[MSAIAppInsights setup];
	[MSAIAppInsights start];
	```

6. Send some data to the server:

	```objectivec	
	// Send an event with custom properties and measuremnts data
	[MSAIMetricsManager trackEventWithName:@"Hello World event!"
								properties:@{@"Test property 1":@"Some value",
											 @"Test property 2":@"Some other value"}
							   mesurements:@{@"Test measurement 1":@(4.8),
											 @"Test measurement 2":@(15.16),
		                                	 @"Test measurement 3":@(23.42)}];

	// Send a message
	[MSAIMetricsManager trackTraceWithMessage:@"Test message"];

	// Manually send pageviews (note: this will also be done automatically)
	[MSAIMetricsManager trackPageView:@"MyViewController"
							 duration:300
					 	   properties:@{@"Test measurement 1":@(4.8)}];

	// Send custom metrics
	[MSAIMetricsManager trackMetricWithName:@"Test metric" 
									  value:42.2];
	```

*Note:* The SDK is optimized to defer everything possible to a later time while making sure e.g. crashes on startup can also be caught and each module executes other code with a delay some seconds. This ensures that applicationDidFinishLaunching will process as fast as possible and the SDK will not block the startup sequence resulting in a possible kill by the watchdog process.

### Swift

2. Open your `AppDelegate.swift` file.
3. Add the following line at the top of the file below your own #import statements:
	
	```swift	
	#import AppInsights
	```
4. Search for the method 
	
	```swift	
	application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions:[NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool`
	```
5. Add the following lines to setup and start the AppInsights SDK:
	
	```swift
	MSAIAppInsights.sharedInstance().setup();
   MSAIAppInsights.sharedInstance().start();
	```
	
	You can also use the following shortcut:

	```swift
	MSAIAppInsights.setup();
   MSAIAppInsights.start();
	```
5. Send some data to the server:
	
	```swift
	// Send an event with custom properties and measuremnts data
	MSAIMetricsManager.trackEventWithName(name:"Hello World event!", 
									properties:@{"Test property 1":"Some value",
												 "Test property 2":"Some other value"},
								   mesurements:@{"Test measurement 1":@(4.8),
												 "Test measurement 2":@(15.16),
 											     "Test measurement 3":@(23.42)});

	// Send a message
	MSAIMetricsManager.trackTraceWithMessage(message:"Test message");

	// Manually send pageviews
	MSAIMetricsManager.trackPageView(pageView:"MyViewController",
									 duration:300,
								   properties:@{"Test measurement 1":@(4.8)});

	// Send a message
	MSAIMetricsManager.trackMetricWithName(name:"Test metric",
										  value:42.2);
	```

## Endpoints 

At this point exceptions as well as other telemetry data are sent to different endpoints.
By default the following endpoints are used to work with the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

* Exceptions: `https://dray-prod.aisvc.visualstudio.com/v2/track`
* Telemetry Data: `https://dc.services.visualstudio.com/v2/track`

To change those endpoints open the `AppInsights.h` file and change the following define statements:

```objectivec
#define MSAI_CRASH_DATA_URL   @"https://dray-prod.aisvc.visualstudio.com/v2/track"
#define MSAI_EVENT_DATA_URL   @"https://dc.services.visualstudio.com/v2/track"
```
<a id="extensions"></a>
## iOS 8 Extensions

The following points need to be considered to use AppInsights SDK iOS with iOS 8 Extensions:

1. Each extension is required to use the same values for version (`CFBundleShortVersionString`) and build number (`CFBundleVersion`) as the main app uses. (This is required only if you are using the same `MSAIInstrumentationKey` for your app and extensions).
2. You need to make sure the SDK setup code is only invoked once. Since there is no `applicationDidFinishLaunching:` equivalent and `viewDidLoad` can run multiple times, you need to use a setup like the following example:

	```objectivec	
	@interface TodayViewController () <NCWidgetProviding>
	@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL didSetupAppInsightsSDK;
	@end

	@implementation TodayViewController

	- (void)viewDidLoad {
		[super viewDidLoad];
		if (!self.didSetupAppInsightsSDK) {
			[MSAIAppInsights setup];
			[MSAIAppInsights start];
          self.didSetupAppInsightsSDK = YES;
       }
    }
    ```

## Additional Options

### Set up with xcconfig

Instead of manually adding the missing frameworks, you can also use our bundled xcconfig file.

1. Select your project in the `Project Navigator` (⌘+1).

2. Select your project.

3. Select the tab `Info`.

4. Expand `Configurations`.

5. Select `AppInsights.xcconfig` for all your configurations (if you don't already use a `.xcconfig` file)

	**Note:** You can also add the required frameworks manually to your targets `Build Phases` and continue with step `7.` instead.

6. If you are already using a `.xcconfig` file, simply add the following line to it

	`#include "../Vendor/AppInsights/Support/AppInsights.xcconfig"`

	(Adjust the path depending where the `Project.xcconfig` file is located related to the Xcode project package)

	**Important note:** Check if you overwrite any of the build settings and add a missing `$(inherited)` entry on the projects build settings level, so the `AppInsights.xcconfig` settings will be passed through successfully.

7. If you are getting build warnings, then the `.xcconfig` setting wasn't included successfully or its settings in `Other Linker Flags` get ignored because `$(inherited)` is missing on project or target level. Either add `$(inherited)` or link the following frameworks manually in `Link Binary With Libraries` under `Build Phases`:
	- `AssetsLibrary`
	- `Foundation`
	- `MobileCoreServices`
	- `Security`
	- `SystemConfiguration`
	- `UIKit`
	- `CoreTelephony`(only required if iOS > 7.0)
